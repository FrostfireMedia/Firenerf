### FireTweaks
Fixing Fireworks, one issue at a time.

#### What is this?
This is a simple plugin that tweaks some things with Fireworks.

#### What does this do?
Currently this just removes player damage from fireworks.

#### Why did I make this?
I play with McMMO a lot, and they use fireworks often. This was great, until damage was added. Now, you are at risk of killing yourself by using abilities underground. This fixes that problem.

#### This doesn't work!
If you're having issues, please make a post about it using [Issues](https://github.com/FrostfireMedia/Firetweaks/issues).
